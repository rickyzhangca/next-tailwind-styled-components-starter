# Starter template for Next.js, Tailwind, styled-components

A template of Next.js + Tailwind + styled-components stack that works out of the box! 

It uses Inter font and also takes advantage of [`tailwind-styled-components`](https://github.com/MathiasGilson/tailwind-styled-component) so you can write Tailwind and style components seamlessly together. It supports all styled component features and enables you to speak Tailwind.
